# OfficeConsoleApp

It's simple console app written in Java which is showing my understanding of OOP.


It has 9 classes and one interface. 

Some classes are abstract including abstract methods. 

There is inheritance between classes. 

Interface is making specific operation to some of the classes.


Static fields and methods.

There is validation of entered numeric data by handling exception during conversion

Enum types. 

Data (instances of classes from the hierarchy) are stored in the program memory in the list structure. (One common list for all subtypes.)
Objects are stored in the local Databaese based on singleton pattern. 


# Features:

--> adding new object

--> removing the object with the given identifier

--> displaying all remembered objects (complete information about each of them)

--> displaying objects of a given subtype

--> displaying objects whose name contains the specified string.

--> performing the operation contained in the interface on all objects of the implementing classes
this interface
